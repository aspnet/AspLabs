# QuickGrid

QuickGrid is a simple and fast data grid for Blazor, with:

 * **A clean and comfortable Blazor-native API**, with extensibility for custom filtering, sorting, etc.
 * **Strong performance** when rendering large amounts of data in any Blazor hosting environment (Server, WebAssembly, .NET MAUI).

It is not intended to replace more full-featured data grids, such as those from commercial component vendors.

### This is experimental

QuickGrid doesn't ship as a supported part of Blazor. The purpose of this experimental package is:

 * To provide a **reference architecture** for a performant data grid component, which others may build on or copy.
 * To provide a **convenient and reliable** standalone free data grid component to Blazor developers who don't require advanced grid features.
 
Even though it doesn't have Microsoft's official support, you are welcome to use it in production like other open source libraries from third parties.
