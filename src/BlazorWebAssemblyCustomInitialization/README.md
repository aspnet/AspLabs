## Blazor custom packaging sample

This sample demonstrates how to transform the publish output of a blazor webassembly application via a package to support scenarios where the default loading process causes issues on a given environment.

The sample is composed of 1 project that deals with building the custom boot extension, and a sample app that demonstrates how the package is consumed.

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.MultipartBundle contains MSBuild targets to customize the Blazor publish output as well as a JS initializer for handling the loading of resources for the custom loading process.

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.MultipartBundle.Tasks contains an MSBuild task that is consumed by Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.MultipartBundle MSBuild targets and that is responsible for generating the contents of the bundle.

## Building the sample and running the sample app
* Run the run.ps1 script on this folder.
* Open the browser and navigate to https://localhost:5001

## Tailoring the publish output for your own environment.
* Copy the code from `src\BlazorWebAssemblyCustomInitialization\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.*` into your own repository.
* Rename projects and namespaces to suit your needs.
* Update the task in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.MultipartBundle.Tasks to perform whatever transformation you want on the blazor publish assets.
* Update the JS initializer in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.MultipartBundle as well as the MSBuild targets if necessary.
* Update any code on the server you might need to make sure the files are served correctly.
