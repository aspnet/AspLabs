ASP.NET Core WebHooks provide support for receiving WebHooks. The packages depend on [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://github.com/aspnet/mvc).

ASP.NET Core MVC is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
